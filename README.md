# UMAP Representation of a Semantle Game

**Find the rendered notebook [here](https://derpylz.github.io/semantle_umap/)**

[Semantle](https://semantle.novalis.org/), created by David Turner, is an interesting spin on the recent trend of word guessing games. Instead of finding similarities in the spelling, semantle compares the semantic similarity between the words. 

Here I threw together a bit of code to visually explore a game of semantle using a UMAP representation of the underlying word2vec word embedding. You can follow along with my bumbling semantle guesses, or, probably more fun, visualize your own guesses.
